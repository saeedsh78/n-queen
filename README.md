This Python script provides a solution to the N-Queens problem using a recursive approach. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.


## How to Use

- Open the script in a Python environment.
- Set the desired number of queens (N) in the script.
- Run the script.

The program will output all possible solutions to the N-Queens problem. Each solution is represented as a chessboard with queens denoted by 'Q' and empty squares denoted by '-'.
